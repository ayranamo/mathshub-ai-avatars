## Demo and source description:
This script combines the functionality of text translation and video creation using external APIs and presents them in an interactive web application using Streamlit.

### Imports
- **streamlit:** The Streamlit library for building interactive web applications.
- **requests:** Library for making HTTP requests.
- **time:** Module for time-related functions.
- **os:** Module for interacting with the operating system, used here for setting environment variables.

### Environment Variables
The script sets environment variables for the OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) and the Synthesia API key (`SYNTHESIA_API_KEY`) using `os.environ`.

### Helper Functions
- **send_request_with_backoff:** Function for making HTTP requests with exponential backoff. It retries requests when encountering rate limiting (status code 429).
- **translate_text:** Function for translating text from a source language to a target language using OpenAI's Chat Completions API.
- **create_video:** Function for creating a video using the Synthesia API. It takes input text, avatar, background, and language settings.

### Page Configuration
- Sets the title and icon for the Streamlit app using `st.set_page_config`.
- Displays the logo and title of the application along with a link to the GitHub repository.

### YouTube Video Embed
- Embeds a YouTube video vertically on the left side of the application with equal padding from the left and upper sides. The video is embedded using an iframe HTML element within a Markdown string.

### Translation and Video Creation Inputs
- Provides dropdowns for selecting source and target languages, text areas for inputting text, and dropdowns for selecting avatar and background settings.
- Includes a button for triggering translation and video creation.

### Translation and Video Creation Logic
- Translates input text to the target language using the `translate_text` function.
- Creates a video from the translated text using the `create_video` function.
- Displays the success message and the video if the creation is successful, or an error message otherwise.
